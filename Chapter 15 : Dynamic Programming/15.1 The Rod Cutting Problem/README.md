# Problem Statement

The **Rod-Cutting Problem** is the following.

Given a rod of length n inches and a table of prices Pi for i=1,2,...,n, determine the maximum revenue Rn obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.Note that if the price Pn for a rod of length n is large enough, an optimal solution may require no cutting at all.

There are 2 solutions to this problem.
1. Buttom-Up fashion.
2. Top-Buttom fashion.

The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).
