# Problem Statement

We state the **Matrix-chain Multiplication problem** as follows : 

Given a chain <A1,A2,...,An> of n matrices, where for i=1,2,...,n, matrix Ai has dimension (Pi-1 X Pi), fully parenthesize the product A1.A2...An in a way that minimizes the number of scalar multiplications.

Time Complexity is O(n^3).
