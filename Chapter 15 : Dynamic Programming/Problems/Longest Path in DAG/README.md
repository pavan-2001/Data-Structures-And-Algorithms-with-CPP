# Problem Statement
 
 **Longest simple path in a directed acyclic graph**
 
 Suppose that we are given a directed acyclic graph G=(V,E) with unweighted edges. Describe a dynamic programming approach fro finding a longest unweighted simple path in the **DAG**. What does the subproblem graph look like? What is the efficiency of your algorithm?
 
 Time Complexity is O(n).
 
 Where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
