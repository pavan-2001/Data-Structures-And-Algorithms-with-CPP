# Problem Statement

A **palindrome** is a nonempty string over some alphabet that reads the same forward and backward. Examples of palindromes are all strings of length 1, **civic**, **racecar**, ans aibophobia (fear of palindromes).

Give an efficient algorithm to find the longest palindrome that is a subsequence of a given input string. For example, given the input **character**, your algorithm should return **carac**.
What is the running time of your algorithm?

Time complexity is O(n^2).

where n is the size of the input string.
