# Problem Statement

**Longest simple path in a directed acyclic graph**

Suppose that we are given a directed acyclic graph G=(V,E) with real-valued weights. Describe a dynamic programming approach for fincing a longest weighted simple path in **DAG**. What does the subproblem graph look like? What is the efficiency of your algorithm?

Time Complexity is O(n).
